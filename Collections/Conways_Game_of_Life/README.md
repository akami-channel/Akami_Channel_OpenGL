Conway's Game of Life:

These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following: Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

not sure if .run_mac.sh and .run_windows.ps1 will work, which is why they are dotfiles
