On Linux, you need the glfw-x11 package.

Note that there are Chapters in here for which there are not yet videos. I am still working on this tutorial series, so the structure and content will be subject to change. Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Note to self: I would like to make a code generator project for this so that, for example, if I want to add the -Wall flag in all the run_linux scripts in all the chapters, I would only need to type it once.

The tutorials branch out. Start with the fundamentals branch, then you can move on to game dev or renderer.
