On Linux, you need the glfw-x11 package.

Note that there are Chapters in here for which there are not yet videos. I am still working on this tutorial series, so the structure and content will be subject to change. Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Note to self: I would like to make a code generator project for this so that, for example, if I want to add the -Wall flag in all the run_linux scripts in all the chapters, I would only need to type it once. Also I could changer the name of shader.h and change it so it tells you which shader program it is building.

The tutorials branch out. Start with the fundamentals branch, then you can move on to game dev or renderer. The "renderer" branch is specifically for rendering advanced fragment shaders in a quad, such as what you would use for ray tracing, ray marching, etc., but not limited to that. I haven't come up with a good name for it, because "renderer" is way too general and doesn't properly describe it. Let me know if you have suggestions.
